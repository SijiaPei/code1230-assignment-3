"[ Influence, A. (2018)] As a result of poor education, many men believe that women want to stay at home and have children, leading to more women than men in rural areas.</p>

Farm women contribute about $8 billion annually to the rural economy through free housework. As pointed out in the report, despite the tremendous contributions made by women, they still account for less than 20 per cent of agricultural decision makers. [ Ltd, O. (2018)] Women are regarded as the main labor force in the countryside, and they do not have the dominant power. Because their ability to work is outstanding, the countryside will leave women as labor force.</p>

On the one hand is to retain the local men, on the other hand is to attract more men from other places here. In order to improve the ideological level of the local people, schools and gymnasiums have been set up in these areas to attract foreigners. As we all know, sports competition is the hobby of many men. As long as there are sports venues, there will be many men. So if the stadium is set up here, more people will come to the stadium, which will increase the number of local men. The survey shows that the local people's thinking is a little backward, so the idea of "women want to stay at home and have children" will be widespread in the minds of the local people. So we can build more schools to educate the local people in ideology, so as to eliminate this idea, let women go to other places or let men stay.</p>
